This info helps with upgrade planning and lifecycle context.
##Action Items Enhancements: Previously, users could perform decision actions on Action Items, but could not provide contextual comments unless configured separately in a process step. This limited communication and traceability in approval workflows.
In Clarity 16.4.0, Action Items have been enhanced to allow users to add comments directly within Clarity.

##Changes Related to Rally: In previous releases, Frictionless Cost Accounting (FCA) calculations in Clarity relied solely on Rally story points to determine team productivity and cost distribution.
In Clarity 16.4.0, a new Rally Calculation Method attribute introduces flexibility by allowing teams to choose between Points or Count when calculating FCA metrics. This enhancement better aligns with various Agile practices and improves the accuracy of cost and productivity analysis.
##Upgrade Impact of Rally changes:
After you upgrade: If both Frictionless Cost Accounting Mapping and Rally Team for Frictionless Cost Accounting attributes are configured in a Team Investment, Clarity automatically sets the Rally Calculation Method to Points during upgrade.
If these attributes are not configured, the Rally Calculation Method is set to Null by default.
Changes to Business Rules: For ADMIN
Business rules in Clarity have been updated to include the following enhancements.
You can now configure up upto 50 business rules per object, up upto a maximum of 250 per blueprint.
The business rule name can now be up to 256 characters, up from 80 in previous releases.
The Source Object attribute has been renamed to Target Object.

##Include Notification Data in Health Report: For Admin
Previously, the system health report provided administrators with details on background job performance, service status, and configuration checks, but did not include visibility into Clarity notification delivery status. This limited administrators’ ability to monitor email and in-app notification activity from a single diagnostic report.
In Clarity 16.4.0, the Health Report has been enhanced to include notification-related data, giving administrators a comprehensive view of notification events, counts, and system-level details related to notification services. This addition helps administrators proactively identify and resolve notification-related issues, ensuring smoother communication between Clarity and end users.
OBS Filter Enhancement:
Previously, when filtering based on Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) attributes, users could only apply the 
Is Empty
 and 
Is Equal To
 operators. This limited flexibility when performing advanced filtering, particularly in scenarios requiring exclusion logic or visibility into non-null OBS associations.
In Clarity 16.4.0, the OBS filtering capability has been enhanced to support two additional operators—
Is Not Empty
 and 
Is Not Equal To
. These operators are available across both Clarity and Reporting, enabling users to create more refined filters for OBS-based data and to improve reporting accuracy and usability.

##Reporting and Data Visualization Enhancements
Clarity 16.4.0 enhances native reporting capabilities to provide more flexibility and better insights.
Key enhancements include:
•	Improved placement and usability of report level filters
•	Ability to configure per period metrics (daily, weekly, monthly) at different levels
•	Improved visualization options for widgets like:
o	Introducing the Ability to Switch Charts
o	Widget Sizing and Adjustment Improvements
o	Null Attribute will Display as None 
o	Introducing the Starred Attribute
o	Hide Borders for Widgets
o	Enhanced Axis Customization
o	New Line Chart Widgets is included.
##New Reports OOTB:
•	Capacity vs. Demand by Resource: Helps organizations identify overallocation, potential resource bottlenecks, and opportunities for better resource planning—previously available in Jaspersoft as resource utilization reports.
•	Financial Budget vs. Forecast by Period: Enables accurate comparison of budgeted vs. forecasted spend, allowing finance teams to proactively address variances.
•	KPIs by Project Type Dashboard: Offers instant analytics on key project metrics, highlighting areas for improvement and allowing continuous delivery optimization.


These enhancements reduce dependency on legacy reporting tools and improve native analytics.
